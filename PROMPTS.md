### Update for adding Song Key
Add a new text field named 'key' to store the song key.  Even though 'key' may seem to be a dropdown of available keys, the 'key' field shoudl be a text field for keyed in entry by the user.  Update the supabase schama and the song editing page to add the new field.  On the song edit page, the new 'Key' field should be between the Title and Chords fields.
